Just thoughts, could I make src/pages and just import those into the root pages folder where like _just_ data layer and routing could happen, but have like the markup and all the hoolabaloo over in src?

Well, the under construction page is coming along! I've been sitting down for too long, though, goodness. Lilly needs taking out in just a few. Next step is to make a few design decisions, organize the code, tweak the colors, sizes, animation, get analytics on it, and deploy! Forget making it responsive, even! Like a madperson!
